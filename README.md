# Stability simulation
Simulation script from Cadiou et al., 2021 (link to add after publication).
Instructions on how to use Rscripts are available on the Rscripts themselves.
Seeds need to be specified in order to make results reproducible.

# General information
Scripts were developed to perform a two-layer Monte-Carlo simulation to assess stability and performance in terms of sensitivity and false detection proportion of various variable selection algorithms used for inference purpose in epidemiology.

For each iteration, a realistic exposome is generated using real exposome data. An continuous Gaussian outcome is then generated assuming it nfluenced to varying extents by a linear combination of factors drawn from this simulated set.
